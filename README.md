slidify
=======

a cool JQuery slideshow plugin




responsive slider option
------------------------

    You can apply the classes 'slidify  responsive  partial' to create a 
    carousel which changes its shape to adapt to the screen.


    Q.  How do I stop the initial animation when the page loads?

    A.  Apply the initial states on the appropriate slide nodes in the HTML/backend. 



(thanks to Graham King a.k.a darkcoding who basically wrote the original code which I repackaged into a plugin!)
