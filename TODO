    1.  Add an option to be able to move a slide incrementally,
        instead of all-the-way at the same time.

        Then you could implement a slideshow thing where you hold
        the mouse button to progress the slide (or something). Also,
        you would be able to implement a design which calls for 
        showing portions of slides, instead of the entire slide!



    2.  BUG   On iOS, if the window is currently being scrolled/panned
              the `complete` callbacks on calls to .animate() 
              MAY NOT RUN for some weird reason


    3.  rename left/right to prev/next etc.
         why?  the button that goes to the next slide might not
         not neccessarily be on the right! etc etc
