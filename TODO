    1.  Add an option to be able to move a slide incrementally,
        instead of all-the-way at the same time.

        Then you could implement a slideshow thing where you hold
        the mouse button to progress the slide (or something). Also,
        you would be able to implement a design which calls for 
        showing portions of slides, instead of the entire slide!
