    1.  Add an option to be able to move a slide incrementally,
        instead of all-the-way at the same time.

        Then you could implement a slideshow thing where you hold
        the mouse button to progress the slide (or something). Also,
        you would be able to implement a design which calls for
        showing portions of slides, instead of the entire slide!



    2.  BUG   On iOS, if the window is currently being scrolled/panned
              vertically while you try to change slides,
              the `complete` callbacks on calls to .animate()
              MAY NOT RUN for some weird reason!

            when you inspect element, there's multiple slides with an 'active';
            class hmmmm

            <div class="slidified">
                ...
                <div class="slides">
                    <div class="slide1 slide active" style="left: 0px; ">
                    <div class="slide2 slide"></div>
                    <div class="slide3 slide active" style="left: -800px; "></div>
                </div>
            </div>



    3.  rename left/right to prev/next etc.
         why?  the button that goes to the next slide might not
         not neccessarily be on the right! etc etc


    4.  check the velocity of a touch event,  if it's really high
        then perform the slide change even if we didnt pass the threshold


    5.  BUG:  if you use one finger to start a slide change, then
              tap again with a second finger,  there will be UI
              weirdness and the slide transition WILL NOT complete
