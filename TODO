    0.  add an option to *periodically* move to the next slide

    1.  Add an option to be able to move a slide incrementally,
        instead of all-the-way at the same time.

        Then you could implement a slideshow thing where you hold
        the mouse button to progress the slide (or something). Also,
        you would be able to implement a design which calls for
        showing portions of slides, instead of the entire slide!



    2.  BUG   On iOS, if the window is currently being scrolled/panned
              vertically while you try to change slides,
              the `complete` callbacks on calls to .animate()
              MAY NOT RUN for some weird reason!

            seems maybe related to... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10482227/javascript-dom-changes-in-touchmove-delayed-until-scroll-ends-on-mobile-safari

            "Note that iOS devices freeze DOM manipulation during scroll,
             queuing them to apply when the scroll finishes."


    3.  rename left/right to prev/next etc.
         why?  the button that goes to the next slide might not
         not neccessarily be on the right! etc etc


    4.  check the velocity of a touch event,  if it's really high
        then perform the slide change even if we didnt pass the threshold


    5.  BUG:  if you use one finger to start a slide change, then
              tap again with a second finger,  there will be UI
              weirdness and the slide transition WILL NOT complete


    6.  some weird bug in iOS 6 breaks stuff when the window is scrolled or something

        it effects jQuery animate etc.

    7.  get rid of or refactor doAnimate()   ...its only used for TOUCH_SIMPLE
        and now I kinda have duplicate code to do TOUCH_SLIDES_WITH_FINGER etc.

    8.  support/test/implement touch for the isPartial block

    9.  log a warning if couldn't find bind next/prev arrow buttons,  e.g.  `opts.left` and `opts.right`
